# Online-Shopping

## Project Overview 

This program creates an e-commerce platform using PHP, allowing users to browse through designer retail products, add them to their shopping cart, and make purchases. Using PHP and MySQL for database management, the platform ensures efficient content displays. HTML and CSS are also used for designing the front end of the e-commerce platform. 

## Features 

- **Product Browsing**: Users can explore various luxury retail products, displayed with images, ratings, descriptions, and prices. These products are fetched from the MySQL database. 
- **Cart System**: Users can add products to their cart for purchase and are given a notice in the case of a duplicate. Carts are preserved throughout user sessions.
